# McGurrin
A touch typing app made in Electron.

## What is it?
I know it sounds crazy, but as a developer I've never learnt how to effectivly touch type, and I'm guessing there are other people like me as well. I'm a big fan of [KeyKey](https://keykey.ninja/) but since most of the time I use a PC or Linux I don't get to use it enough to improve. It would be great to have a tool that works on all three systems and the web, that's why I'm making McGurrin.

## Developing

If you'd like to contribute feel free, the project is at it's early stages but I want to build lots of features that would make learning to touch type fun and easy.

Getting started is simple.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Currently I'm writing the app in TypeScript and using Parcel as the bundler.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Fast and modern interface.
- [ ] Gradual progression to more keys.
- [ ] Better statistics and data.
- [ ] Arbitary keyboard layouts.
- [ ] Cloud storing of achievements and progression.
- [ ] Themes and UI tweaks.
- [ ] Installers for all major OS'.
